OpenGPXMapper
=============

**Disclaimer**: this code is not plished yet, it needs a lot of cleanup.

Web based application that lets you track GPX tracks on a map, initally created
to track my cycle routes, it turns out to be convenient to track basically
everyting (it quite funny to see high-speed trains routes).

The server side component is developped in Python and uses:
* [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org)
* [gpxpy](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy)
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)

# TODO
* Clanup code
* Make a proper documentation
* Remove 3rd party libraries from source tree

# License
**The 3rd party livraries in the source tryy may be licenced under different terms**
